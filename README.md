# Aura
By: Camille Etienne & Kendall Daniels


Aura is an iOS application thats main functionality is to cater to its users’ moods using their music library. 
By using the song BPMs (beats per minute) as the parameters to determine an “upbeat” or “slow” song, the
songs queued for streaming are filtered by the mood the user would like to proceed with for that
session. Aura offers these moods in the form of three categories: “Ignite,” “Retain,” and
“Suppress.” The “Ignite” selection will determine whether or not users would like to stream
“upbeat” music, meaning the rate of beats per minute would increase (songs with more than 120
bpm). The “Retain” selection will maintain the users’ mood, whether they are calm or
concentrated (songs with 76 - 120 bpm). Finally, the “Suppress” selection will suppress the
moods of the users, putting them in a more calming mood by decreasing beats per minute (songs
with 60 - 75 bpm).

This application came as an idea for an extension to a device called Muse (https://choosemuse.com)
that uses EEG signals to monitor brain activity for meditation purposes.
